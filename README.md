# CryptoClustering

This project uses unsupervised learning techniques including k-means clustering and PCA to predict changes cryptocurrencies.

Methodology
1-create a dataframe for the crypto market data and use coin_id field as the index
2-find best value for k using the elbow method then create scatter plot of k number of clusters
3-find best value for k for PCA using the elbow method then create a scatter plot of k number of clusters
4-compare the two scatter plots to determine if reducing the dimensionality of the data is beneficial to the accuracy of the output.
